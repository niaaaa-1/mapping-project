      <h3>Construction for Northern Blvd High School in Queens Set to Begin</h3>

  <p>Classrooms in Queens will get a little less crowded thanks to a new high school that broke ground in Woodside on Wednesday.</p>
  <p>The new 3,066 seat Northern Boulevard High School is the School Construction Authority’s largest high school building project to date and will help address the overcrowding in Queens high schools. The borough leads the city in the number of over capacity schools.</p>

  <p>This historic project will bring thousands of new (classroom) seats to Queens,” said New York City School Chancellor Meisha Porter, “It will provide students with the state of the art facilities, where they can learn and grow.</p>


  <p>The groundbreaking comes two days after Queens lawmakers asked for the School’s chancellor to suspend geographic priority for high schools across the city. As of December 2020, geographic priority for admission into certain high schools has been eliminated, meaning students do not have a preference to certain schools just because they live close. Lawmakers are asking for this to be overturned because it further promotes overcrowding and far commutes for students.</p>

  <p>The School Construction Authority is responsible for designing and constructing safe, attractive, and environmentally sound public schools for children throughout the many communities of New York City.  To address overcrowding in Queens, the SCA will also be opening four high schools where the goal is to increase high class sitting by 6,200.</p>

  <p>The new school building will be six stories high, air-conditioned, accessible, and the school will also have 18 special education classes and a program for students with specialized needs.  It will also have two dining areas where students can eat and still be properly socially distanced. Students who have returned to school since the coronavirus pandemic have found it hard to social distance themselves, according to an article by the NY Post. </p>

  <p>“This school represents our mission to invest in New York City’s future, continuing to create the school buildings that our students need and deserve while also continuing to fulfill the mayor’s commitment to reduce overcrowding and increase diversity,” said Nina Kubota, the president and chief executive officer of New York City SCA. “Today’s groundbreaking mark’s the next step in bringing thousands of new seats to Queens.”</p>

  <p>The project is set to be open for the 2025-2026 scholastic year.<p>
